# Soft Electromagnetic Docking Control System

This Simulink project models a soft electromagnetic docking system using a state-space approach and a simple feedback loop.
Control law involves usage of state space model with negative feedback and two stage filter tracking error. Further works include usage of time-delayed control for better control

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: MATLAB and Simulink (R2023a or later).
2. **Run the Simulation**: Open `dop.slx` in Simulink, set parameters, and run the simulation.
3. **Extend/Modify**: Adapt the model for specific needs or integrate it into larger systems.

## Applications

- Robotic and automated docking systems
- Soft robotics control
- Educational purposes
